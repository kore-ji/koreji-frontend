# Koreji Frontend

Koreji Frontend is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) repository created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) for the Koreji application.

## Prerequisites

Install the tooling before running any project scripts:

1. **Node.js + npm** (use the latest LTS release—Expo currently recommends Node 18+).

   ```bash
   # via nvm (https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
   nvm install --lts
   nvm use --lts
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

2. **PNPM** (preferred package manager for this repo).

   ```bash
   corepack enable         # ships with recent Node versions
   corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
   pnpm -v
   ```

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   pnpm start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

```

## Quality checks

Every pull request and push to `main` triggers the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The pipeline installs dependencies with PNPM and runs:

- `pnpm lint` – Expo ESLint rules via `expo lint`.
- `pnpm test` – currently runs TypeScript `--noEmit` checks through the `typecheck` script.

Run the same commands locally before opening a PR to catch issues early.
